# **Student Direcotry**
## ~~not a discription~~
## The goal of this tutorial is not only to show you the Ruby code that you'll need to write (that's the easy bit) but to show you the process of creating a project from scratch. Most importantly we'll explain what to do, in what order and why do it at all. The script will be invoked from the command-line and it will only use pure Ruby, that is, there will be no external libraries to use. It will have text-based interface that will not look particularly exciting but it's really important to understand how to build basic things before trying to create sophisticated websites.
